# 📚 Figma to Code AI Workflow Documentation

Welcome to the future of frontend development! This documentation covers the revolutionary Figma → AI → Code workflow.

## 📖 Documentation Structure

### 1. 🛠️ [Setup Guide](./FIGMA_TO_CODE_SETUP.md)
Complete step-by-step instructions for setting up the Figma + AI workflow with Cursor. Includes:
- Prerequisites and installation
- Figma API token generation
- MCP configuration
- Troubleshooting guide

### 2. 🎯 [Quick Reference](./FIGMA_AI_QUICK_REFERENCE.md)
A handy cheat sheet for daily use containing:
- Essential commands
- Configuration snippets
- Common fixes
- Pro tips

### 3. 🎬 [Example Workflow](./EXAMPLE_WORKFLOW.md)
Real-world example showing:
- Actual Figma to React conversion
- Step-by-step process
- Time comparisons
- Best practices

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **New to this workflow?** Start with the [Setup Guide](./FIGMA_TO_CODE_SETUP.md)
2. **Already set up?** Keep the [Quick Reference](./FIGMA_AI_QUICK_REFERENCE.md) handy
3. **Want to see it in action?** Check the [Example Workflow](./EXAMPLE_WORKFLOW.md)

## 💡 Why This Matters

This workflow represents the convergence of:
- **Visual Design** (Figma)
- **AI Understanding** (Claude/Cursor with MCP)
- **Modern Development** (React, TypeScript, Tailwind)

It's what tools like Dreamweaver promised but never delivered - now with AI that truly understands both design and code.

## 🎯 Success Metrics

Teams using this workflow report:
- **80% faster** component development
- **Pixel-perfect** accuracy
- **Better designer-developer** collaboration
- **More time** for complex features
